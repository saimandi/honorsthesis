            "Expected Answer: it does not take much force at all to crush the larynx. crushing the human throat takes roughly that same amount of pressure as crushing an empty soda container. this is why a move such as a throat gouge should never be used in a fight. the only time this kind of move should be used is if it is life or death. a hit to the throat can easily kill a person and is not to joked with. i hope this clears your doubts.\n",

However, it is a useful tool for identifying individuals who are at risk for health problems. The BMI is calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters. The BMI is then classified into the following categories: underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal weight (BMI = 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI = 25-29.9), and obese (BMI ≥ 30).\n",

            "Expected Answer: you seem concerned by the bump on tattoo immediately after getting the tattoo done which is persisting even after 1 month and getting harder bigger and painful. tattoos breach the skin which means that skin infections and other complications are possible. sometimes bumps called granulomas form around tattoo ink â especially red ink. tattooing can also lead to raised areas caused by an overgrowth of scar tissue (keloids). this might be the case with you and you must consult a dermatologist for the definitive diagnosis and management as the same is not possible online. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional.\n",

            "Expected Answer: you would like to know whether someone with hypoglycemia can live on a vegetarian diet. a vegetarian diet is a diet or lifestyle that seeks to exclude the use of animals for food. properly planned vegan diets are healthful and have been found to satisfy nutritional needs. poorly planned vegan diets can be low in levels of calcium iodine vitamin b12 and vitamin d. vegans are therefore encouraged to plan their diet and take dietary supplements such as vitamin b12 vitamin d calcium iodine and omega-3 fatty acids. these deficiencies have potentially serious consequences including anemia rickets and cretinism in children and osteomalacia and hypothyroidism in adults. given the data that you provided of hypoglycemia hunger blurred vision of your left eye and weight loss it is likely that you experience them because your body is not adjusting to that diet and the low calorie intake. since you experience thyroid cancer the needs for energy are increased because the cancer causes the metabolism to work faster and to spend the energy faster. if the body doesn't have enough energy it starts to lose in weight and hypoglycemia is the consequence. you may consider changing the diet back to normal or to increase the energy intake while still vegetarian but to take more vitamin mineral and omega-3 fatty acids supplements. please keep in mind that i provide medical information only. i am not able to diagnose medical conditions online. please contact your doctor or other healthcare provider such as nutritionist for further advice and information.\n",

            "Expected Answer: thinness and fitness are two different things. one can be thin and yet fit whereas one can be fat and unhealthy. what is important is that the weight should not be below the normal percentile for your age waist circumference and height. if that is the case the probably you do not eat well. if you eat well you may be having worms in the stool. hence a stool test is a must. if your family in general is thin and skinny there is nothing much you can do about it. even without genetic predominance some people are light weight. the other factors are presence of diseases like diabetes hyperthyroidism tuberculosis poor diet eating disorders malabsorption syndromes and cancers. you can consult your doctor regarding this and eliminate these causes of low weight. if all is fine consult a nutrition expert and build up a good diet program. a physical fitness trainer then can help you gain some muscle mass. however do not go for this unless the medical causes are ruled out because you may need to modify the diet and exercise program according to the problem you have. hope this helps. take care!\n",

            "Expected Answer: it is very difficult situation when relationships break after a long time of being together. when expectations of every individual in a relation change or are not met it is usual to think about the future of the relation itself. at this point of time though it is very difficult to come to terms you have to get yourself together and try to seek help from a counselor or a psychiatrist to help you analyse the situation. take this time to know if the person you are yearning for is right for you. in case you do think he is the right person give him some time apart to analyse for himself if he has indeed feelings for you or not. in case he does come around then your relation will grow much stronger. crying and breaking yourself down might make him feel that you are clingy or dependent on him and hence his attraction for you might reduce. show that you are strong and are confident enough to hold on by yourself. get into other activities like working out or take a vacation alone or with friends and family to get back into your rhythm. this will help to tide over the situation. i hope this helps.\n",

            "Expected Answer: you seem concerned by the impending break up with your boyfriend after the relationship had gone bad to worse over the last few months. you have also made a mention of your boyfriend saying that he is not a normal person mentally. you need to arrange a psychiatric consultation for your boyfriend to find out what is mentally wrong with him. if both of you love each other and there is no one for whom he might have developed a liking then getting adequate help for him for a possible depression can help ease the situation and save a relationship from breaking up. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional.\n",

It's great that you're considering your health and the health of your baby. In general, it's recommended that women avoid strenuous activities during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, since you're already 4 weeks pregnant and have been exercising regularly, it's likely that your body has already adapted to the physical demands of exercise.  However, it's still important to take precautions to ensure your safety and the safety of your baby. Here are some tips to consider:  1. Listen to your body: If you're feeling tired or uncomfortable during exercise, stop and rest. 2. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water before, during, and after exercise. 3. Avoid overheating: Take regular breaks to cool down and avoid overheating. 4. Avoid high altitudes: If you're planning to hike at high altitudes, consider postponing your trip until after your baby is born. 5. Avoid activities that involve a high risk of injury: Avoid activities that involve a high risk of injury, such as contact sports or activities that involve a high risk of falling. 6. Avoid activities that involve a high risk of dehydration: Avoid activities that involve a high risk of dehydration, such as activities that involve prolonged periods of exercise in hot weather.\n",

            "Expected Answer: hello and welcome to ehealth forum! this is a personal and religious decision but considering the circumstances it is best to opt for abortion. otherwise you need to inform your parents about it. the best way to do is go for a dilatation and curettage. vacuum evacuation can be tried before 7 weeks of pregnancy. if you do not want that then you can try a drug which contains a chemical called mifepristone. the best method through pills is a combination of mifepristone plus prostaglandin. discuss this with the gynecologist. i would suggest you consult a gynecologist if your pregnancy test is positive and not go for any pills on your own as they carry the danger of incomplete abortion and very heavy bleeding. a dose higher than the required dose can cause damage to the uterus too. so please do not self medicate. after the termination think in terms of inserting iud or other such devices like implanon or go for pills. please consult your gynecologist. hope this helps. take care!\n",

            "Expected Answer: a pregnancy that ends before the 28th week is not considered a birth but is medically called a \"miscarriage\". pregnancies that end between the 28th and 38th week are considered premature births. the normal duration of a pregnancy is considered to last between 38 and 42 weeks. if a pregnancy lasts for more than 42 weeks it is considered an \"over-kept pregnancy\". six months is less than 28 weeks so it seems that you probably had a miscarriage. there could be many reasons for miscarriage: 1. genetic malformations of the fetus; 2. fetal damage caused by viral infections toxoplasmosis drugs irradiationâ¦; 3. vaginal infection; 4. trauma; 5. cervical failure; 6. uterusâs tumors etc. you can consult your gynecologist to find out the precise cause for the miscarriage in your case.\n",

            "Expected Answer: you seem concerned by the emotional lability during pregnancy along with the feeling that your husband is not supportive and is emotionally and verbally abusing you. two main hormones estrogen and progesterone cause mood swings during pregnancy. emotions are always unstable and feeling of depression is normal as any other body changes during pregnancy. the third trimester is the most anxious one. this is the period when mother-to-be worries about everything and anything that she can think of. however her major cause of anxiety lies not just on the labour and delivery process but also in baby care and parenting in general. you might be feeling physically uncomfortable with the growth of the abdomen and may feel irritated with the lightest noise as you lack sleep in general. it may be more extreme if your partner is unresponsive to your special requirements during pregnancy as he may not realise that the mood swings are normal in pregnancy. however if the mood swings of anxiety sadness and anger continuously persist more than two weeks you must meet the practitioner. you may be suffering from depression that needs immediate care and attention called bipolar disorder. a survey states that untreated emotional health problems can affect your baby's physical well being and increase the risk of preterm labor and postpartum depression. get treated with the right psychotherapy and medication for effective results. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional.\n",

            "Question: my 1 month old caught the common cold from his older sister. what will the doctors do or give him if i take him to the hospital; being that he is so young?\n",
            "Expected Answer: babies have received the immunity from the mother when they were still in the womb. this protects the baby in the first six months of its life. however this makes the baby susceptible to viruses and bacteria at the same rate as the mother. when you take the baby to a doctor a physical examination of the nose the throat and the lungs would be done. laboratory tests needed to detect the exact cause of the infection are likely to be performed too. since a common cold is usually caused by a virus the doctor might decide not to prescribe antibiotics and instead opt to wait and see. if the baby has a fever antipyretics would be recommended. if a bacterial cause is detected then adequate antibiotics would be given. the only specific thing about this is that not all antibiotics are recommended for babies. but do not worry. a -pediatrician whom you are advised would know what antibiotic is allowed to be given to your baby. a pump to take out the fluid from the nose would ease the babyâs breathing. this would also help the baby to eat because a running nose might make the breastfeeding more difficult because the baby would keep gasping for air.\n",

            "Expected Answer: your concern is regarding the pain that you are having in the face jaw ear and eye. without physical examination it is very difficult to confirm and it can be either tmj or toothache. tmj pain disorders usually occur because of unbalanced activity spasm or overuse of the jaw muscles. this causes inflammation of the jaw joint and hence severe pain which may radiate to the ears as well. diagnosis is confirmed by x-rays or ct of the joint. you can apply warm compresses to the joint and take anti inflammatory pain killer drugs after consulting your doctor. a physical therapist can also be approached as craniosacral therapy to relax the muscles and fascia of the jaw is very helpful in relieving the pain. it is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. for exact diagnosis you are requested to consult your doctor. i sincerely hope that helps. take care.\n",

            "Expected Answer: your concern is regarding the recurrent chalazia that your wife is having especially when she is planning for chemo/ stem cell transplant. a chalazion is an accumulation of material in the eyelid as a result of a blocked oil gland and there is no underlying cause for the same. for recurrent chalazia your wife can use pre-moistened eyelid cleansing wipes to maintain hygiene. other than that regular use of topical or oral antibiotics can also be prescribed to prevent any further recurrence. however if the size is big or it is obstructing field of vision then it may need to be removed surgically. patients with underlying conditions such as rosacea seborrheic dermatitis or blepharitis are more prone to multiple and recurrent chalazia. so your wife needs to get evaluated for these conditions also as they may be responsible for recurrent chalazia. it is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. for exact diagnosis you are requested to consult your doctor. i sincerely hope that helps. take care.\n",

            "Expected Answer: like other eye surgeries even femtolasik surgery has its own side effects. these include: 1) dryness of eyes can be caused by effect on the nerves producing tears. 2) there may be increased sensitivity to light but this is a temporary side effect. 3) there may be decreased night vision which is again a temporary side effect but may persist for a long time in some people. 4) there may be over or under correction of vision which may even require a repeat surgery 5) it may cause too thin or irregular corneas. this may cause irregular astigmatism. 6) it may also cause high refractive error and unstable vision. 7) it may also cause growth of cells from outer layer of the cornea under the flap <positive_smiley> rare side effects include infection and retinal damage. you should discuss the pros and cons with an ophthalmologist and then go on for famtolasik surgery. it is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. for exact diagnosis you are requested to consult your doctor. i sincerely hope that helps. take care.\n",

            "Expected Answer: clubbing is the bulbous enlargement of one or more fingers of the hand/hands or toe/toes of one or both feet due to the proliferation and edema of the connective tissue which result in loss of the normal angle between the nail plate and it's adjacent skin. clubbing can both be acquired and familial/genetic. there are so many causes of clubbing lung cancer being one of them (and not the only cause). in your case the clubbing is unilateral(involves one hand) while mostly in lung cancer the clubbing is bilateral also by the time clubbing is evident in moat of the lung cancer patients they have developed all other miserable symptoms of the disease which i hope you don't have. unilateral clubbing can occur due to the axillary artery aneurysm or brachial arterio-venous malformations so you should probably get these two ruled out first if your clubbing in one hand appeared recently with the other hand being completely fine. wishing you the best of health take care and thank you.\n",

            "Expected Answer: you seem concerned by the swollen neck with pain and swelling behind the ears as well. you have also made a mention of shooting pains in the head along with the feeling of dizziness and a suggested diagnosis of chickenpox. older children teenagers and young adults are likely to have more severe cases of chicken pox than young children. they usually have more sores run a temperature for longer and may experience some nausea. initial symptoms of chicken pox are usually ignored. one may have slight nasal congestion a loss in appetite or one may feel tired or run down. these symptoms may occur for a day or two before other manifestations of chicken pox. most children with chickenpox act sick with symptoms such as a fever headache tummy ache or loss of appetite for a day or two before breaking out in the classic pox rash. the outcome is generally excellent in uncomplicated cases. encephalitis pneumonia and other invasive bacterial infections are serious but rare complications of chickenpox. in your son's case the second possibility is of measles which shall also be ruled out in consultation with your personal physician. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional.\n",

It is a common injury in athletes and individuals who participate in sports that involve running, jumping, and quick changes of direction. The injury is usually caused by a sudden, forceful contraction of the muscle. The symptoms of a grade 2 calf muscle injury include pain, swelling, and bruising in the calf. The pain is usually felt in the calf and may radiate down to the ankle. The pain is usually worse with activity and may be relieved with rest. The swelling and bruising may be present in the calf and may be worse with activity. The symptoms of a grade 2 calf muscle injury usually begin within 24 hours of the injury and may last for several days.\n",

It can be caused by a variety of factors such as hormonal imbalance, nutritional deficiencies, stress, genetics, and certain medical conditions. Hair loss can be classified into two main categories: androgenetic alopecia and alopecia areata. Androgenetic alopecia is the most common form of hair loss and is caused by the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT causes hair follicles to shrink and eventually stop producing hair. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss. It is characterized by the sudden loss of hair from the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, and other areas of the body. The hair loss is usually patchy and can be accompanied by itching and redness of the scalp.\n",

This condition is also known as Edwards syndrome. The extra copy of chromosome 18 causes delays in development and other health problems.  The signs and symptoms of trisomy 18 vary widely among affected individuals. Many people with this condition have severe intellectual disability and delayed development. They may have distinctive facial features, including a small head, a wide mouth, and a small jaw.  Most people with trisomy 18 have heart defects. They may also have abnormalities of the kidneys, urinary tract, and digestive system.  Some people with trisomy 18 have a condition called congenital heart disease with atrioventricular canal defect. This condition is characterized by a hole in the wall between the upper and lower chambers of the heart (atrioventricular canal).  People with trisomy 18 often have a condition called clubfoot, which is a foot deformity that causes the foot to be twisted inward.

            "Expected Answer: your concern is probably regarding the surgery for chronic pancreatitis i. e. whipple's procedure. there is acceptable alteration of lifestyle after the whipple operation. most patients are able to go back to their normal functional levels. many studies show that there is no statistical difference looking at physical abilities psychological issues social issues functional capabilities and disabilities when comparing whipple with the other surgeries like laparoscopic gall bladder removal. some of the long-term consequences of the whipple operation include the following: 1. mal-absorption: the pancreas produces enzymes required for digestion of food. in some patients removal of part of the pancreas during the whipple operation can lead to a diminished production of these enzymes. patients complain of bulky diarrhea type of stool that is very oily. long-term treatment with oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation usually provides relief from this problem. 2. alteration in diet: after the whipple operation it is generally recommended that the patients ingest smaller meals and snack between meals to allow better absorption of the food and to minimize symptoms of feeling of being bloated or getting too full. 3. loss of weight: it is common for patients to lose up to 5 to 10% of their body weight compared to their weight prior to their illness. the weight loss usually stabilizes very rapidly and most patients after a small amount of initial weight loss are able to maintain their weight and do well. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional.\n",

            "Expected Answer: the healing of a fractured bone depends on many factors. 1. type of fracture - compound fractures - take much longer to heal. 2. displaced bone fragments - if the bone edges and parts have been displaced then the risk of delayed union and nonunion increase. 3. infection - increases the healing time. 4. disruption of the blood flow to the fracture site - also hampers healing 5. malnutrition bone disorders also prolong the healing time. 6. early mobilization of the joint - before complete healing. in your case you have 2 or more factors which have caused the delay in your recovery. without first hand knowledge of your current condition examination of your xrays and a physical examination it would not be possible to give exact possibility of your prognosis. i am sorry about that. but platelet rich plasma (prp) does contain important cytokines and growth factors which when injected into a injured area helps to improve the rate of healing (bone formation in your case) and hence your recovery. as mentioned in your history you may already might have had some progress. hence if the fractured bone site heals completely (which will eventually happen in due time) - there is no doubt that you will be able to walk normally on the affected foot. i hope this helps.\n",

            "Expected Answer: you seem concerned about the stiffness in your 17 month old baby diagnosed with cerebral palsy. cerebral palsy hinders proper motor development due to which a child's movement and muscle coordination gets impaired. however there are a number of treatments that help a child overcome his disabilities. of all these physical therapy for cerebral palsy is of great help. a physical therapist is trained to improve muscle coordination and movement through exercise and other devices. positioning is done to reduce unwanted tone and to attain long stretches. for this purpose a number of devices like braces knee mobilisers pillows casts or splints may be used. the bobath treatment aims to improve posture and movement to enable more realistic functioning in daily life. through specialised ways of handling stiffness can be reduced muscle control against gravity increased and fluctuating muscle activity stabilised. depending on the severity of the condition the child may be better able to learn how to sit up use his/her hands to stand up to stand and to walk. ideally the treatment will be an integral part of the daily routine for that child. for example the way the child is picked up carried put down or positioned when sitting will enable parents/carers to enhance the child's ability and function. the aims of the treatment are goal-orientated and influenced by several factors such as the age of the child severity of their condition and their motivation. treatment is planned for each child via assessment. some of the areas that will be assessed are: â¢ the patterns of movement the child presents with; â¢ age-appropriate movements that the child may not be achieving or may find difficult; â¢ the child's present capabilities; â¢ examination of the child's posture in different situations and positions. once the child has been assessed a prioritized 'problem-solving' list will be formulated and then appropriate techniques used to address these areas. positioning is very important in bobath treatment. correct positioning helps improve movements. experience of different positions is necessary to improve overall body control and reduce the risk of unnecessary poor posture. handling a child using key points on the body allows the therapist to manipulate the child to correct their movements. help may be given with movements like chewing handling objects moving about sitting or lying down. even when a child is being carried using correct positioning and handling of 'key points' on the child's body is considered very important as this lets the child experience as far possible normal movement patterns. you may consult a physical therapist for more detailed assessment and the use of devices and machines. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional.\n",

            "Expected Answer: it seems that you brother is experiencing gastro esophageal reflux disease (gerd). stomach acid goes up in to the esophagus causing erosive oesophagitis and ulcers. traditionally anti-acid medicines are used to relieve symptoms. although these can help ease the symptoms sometimes they are not a long-term cure. if not treated effectively an infant or adolescent can be reliant on anti acid medicines for long periods of time. because medication has not proven successful in the long-term the next option is a surgical procedure called 'nissen fundoplication'. this involves an operation on the abdomen through a reasonably large incision (unless performed via keyhole surgery 'laparoscopy). the top of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus (gullet) - making it act like a valve and stopping the reflux. the complication rate is 15-60% resulting in patients not being able to 'burp' swallowing difficulties and not being able to vomit. with a viral-like vomiting illness this can cause problems in itself. it should be a permanent surgical correction but between 10-30% of patients will need the procedure to be repeated within 5 years. however there is now a new alternative using the endoscope via the mouth. with this new procedure - called 'endoscopic fundoplication'- there are no abdominal incisions at all and the operation is done through the endoscope - through the mouth and it is easily repeatable if required at a later date or easily undone if required. the endoscopic fundoplication procedure is done under a general anesthetic. most patients are able to have this done as a day case or as an overnight stay. following the operation patients are advised to limit physical activity for the first 4 weeks and to avoid any contact sport. anti sickness medication is required for 48 hours after the procedure and patients are told to avoid lumpy food for the first 4 weeks. the long-term results of this procedure indicate that of 31 people 3 had to have the procedure repeated at 1-3 years after the operation and 2 required the surgical fundoplication. only 3 remain taking any medication. no medication is usually needed after the procedure and patients are usually symptom free. about those laughter attacks you can consult a neurologist; they are probably caused by his preexisting condition-cerebral palsy.\n",

            "Expected Answer: cerebral palsy is a condition in which certain of the muscles (most often in the extremities) are affected thus causing muscle weakness up to paralysis. this might cause a disability of a certain degree in the person which would interfere in the everyday life driving ability included. however there are many car modifications that might help people with a driving disability. in the beginning it might be best to visit a doctor who might be able to determine the degree of disability and the modifications needed. in different countries there are associations that try to improve the life of people with disabilities. they also organize driver rehabilitation programs run by driver rehabilitation specialists. you might want to check if there is such an association in your country. they also might be able to tell you about legal issues related to drivers with disabilities. as for the problems you are experiencing (difficulty in releasing the clutch and pressing the accelerator at the same time; the gear handling is also difficult with steering) it might be easily solved if you buy a car with an automatic transmission. this would eliminate the need for a clutch and a manual shift. the problem with the poor road sense might need training from a driving rehabilitation specialist.\n",

            "Expected Answer: despite optimal treatment hepatocellular carcinoma continues to have a high recurrence rate. hepatocellular carcinoma recurs in 50-80% of patients following resection the majority of which occur within 2 years and that odds are increased with superinfection of hcv virus and complicated by cirrhosis. it needs a complete clinical correlation and grading of tumor before devising any plan. tace transcatheter arterial chemo embolization is the method of choice for hcc these days. get to hepatobiliary surgeons for further management. take care\n",

            "Expected Answer: as all of the clinical data in this area is retrospective in nature i can only comment on what has been published tgus far. most of these studies show no significant increase in the risk of congenital abnormalities in children born to women who have previously been treated with chemotherapy and intracranial radiation therapy for leukemia. likewise the rate of leukemia recurrence following pregnancy appears to be relatively low (although there is always a small risk of delayed recurrence of leukemia with or without pregnancy). you should of course discuss your concerns with both your oncologist and your gynecologist before deciding to try and have a child. based upon the available evidence however it would appear to be reasonably safe for you to become pregnant if your have been in complete remission for the past 10 years. if you do decide to become pregnant then you will have to be carefully monitored for any signs of all recurrence during and after your pregnancy;. sincerely/ robert a. wascher md facs <link>\n",

            "Expected Answer: radioactive iodine (rai) is often chosen for treatment of conditions associated with overactive thyroid including hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancers. rai treatment is based on the fact that the thyroid actively accumulates iodine which it uses to produce thyroid hormones required for normal body function. the therapeutic action of rai is via disruption of the function of the thyroid cells - the more radioactive iodine given the more cells cease to function. as the cells stop functioning excessive amounts of thyroid hormones are no longer produced and symptoms of hyperthyroidism begin to disappear. in your case the side effects of such therapy will be limited to short term effects like sore throat nausea fatigue etc. there will be no effect on other organs like kidneys nor any effect on the sexual desire and sexual function. but once the treatment is completed you will need lifelong therapy with thyroxine supplements to prevent hypothyroidism related symptoms.\n",

The most common cause of a lump near the Adam's apple is a cyst. Cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can occur in any part of the body. They are usually benign and do not cause any symptoms.

            "Expected Answer: it is very difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis with the information that you have given about your 4 year old nephew but i will still hint at the possibilities. the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school 4 out of 5 days. as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school. the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken language(as you said that his speech is hard to understand) preoccupation with stereotyped interest(as in going to bathroom on the porch). the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speech(before he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated) aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc. the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence. so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life. all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person. you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology. hope this helps. take care.\n",

            "Expected Answer: autism is a medical condition in which there are problems with communication and social interaction. this is a rather serious condition to be diagnosed without a complex and complete examination. the child might lack eye contact as you mentioned. the babbling in these children might be accompanied with unusual gestures repeating othersâ words whereas the words are less frequently associated with appropriate gestures. repetitive behaviour might be one of the symptoms that are most easy to recognize. it might include: compulsive behaviour ritualistic behaviour stereotypy or even self-injury. as for the slow improvement of the speech please consider that many children just need more time to talk and to be understood. different conditions might be causing this situation. sometimes the child might need help from a specialist for speech and language therapy whom you are advised to visit. s/he might be able to detect if there are any physiological problems with the speech-related organs (the tongue the palate the throat) or the child simply needs more time to develop the speech. to exclude autism you might want to take your child to a neuropsychologist pediatrician. until than please keep in mind that there are many children at the age of 19 months whose speech is not fluent enough to be understood clearly.\n",

            "Expected Answer: i can understand your situation and know it is difficult to cope with a child with adhd/ odd. he might not be ready to take medications which is quite normal and acceptable. since it is necessary for him to take it you can give him medicatios by saying that they are some other ones and donot make him feel as if he is suffering from some disorder. give him time and be calm and patient. avoid any kind of struggle and arguments. recognise his good behaviour and offer rewards. ask him to do some yoga and meditation exercises which would relax his mind to an extent. spend quality time with him and involve him in activities which he is fond of. hope this helps!\n",

            "Expected Answer: hello. from your description here it seems you are troubled with the anger issues more than anything else. and the recurrence of the anger is probably a reason why you want to know if this could be bipolar disorder. however the symptoms you have described here are not sufficient to diagnose or rule out bipolar disorder. mood symptoms are prominent in bipolar disorder. usually there should be alternate periods of depression and mania/hypomania with intervening period of normal behavior and mood. there could even be two or more consecutive manic or depressive episodes. but the most important criteria is to have episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. anxiety also seems to play a major role in the emotional disturbances you might have. even without having a diagnosis for this you can start working towards improving the situation. ideally you should consult a psychiatrist for a better understanding of the situation. if that is not possible you can start with a few exercises for stress relief such as the jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation. as to the anger it is important to exercise rational thinking 'during' a situation that normally produces the anger. rational thinking can be viewed as a thinking pattern which allows you to reach your goals with minimum emotional disturbances. it needs practice and it can be learned with the help of a psychotherapist but you can certainly try it until you can manage to consult a doctor. hope this helps. abhijeet deshmukh md (this post is for the purpose of providing medical information and is not a substitute for a face-to-face consultation with a doctor. this post is not intended to give or rule out a diagnosis create a doctor-patient relationship or replace an existing one. i am not able to diagnose medical conditions online. please consult with your doctor or a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment options)\n",

            "Expected Answer: the description provided indicates that you might be having a mood disorder (bipolar disorder). but additional history and a face to face discussion is needed to know the exact problem. for a proper diagnosis and treatment you might benefit by consulting a psychiatrist who can take a complete history and then decide on the treatment measures.\n",
